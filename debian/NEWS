ipvsadm (1:1.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  - This update removes support for kernels 2.2 and 2.4 as they aren't supported
    on Debian anymore. 
  - Since autosaving of rules is harmfull if you remove nodes on the fly at
    the commandline (see #275986 and #337207) I decided to disable this
    feature. If you want your rules to be saved please execute
    "/etc/init.d/ipvsadm save".
