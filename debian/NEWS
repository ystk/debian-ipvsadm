ipvsadm (1:1.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version removes automatic configuration of ipvsadm via debconf to
  simplify the package. In most cases the approach is to naive to be useful.

  If you want to run ipvsadm on boot, or change bootoption just modify 
  /etc/default/ipvsadm.

ipvsadm (1:1.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  - This update removes support for kernels 2.2 and 2.4 as they aren't supported
    on Debian anymore. 
  - Since autosaving of rules is harmfull if you remove nodes on the fly at
    the commandline (see #275986 and #337207) I decided to disable this
    feature. If you want your rules to be saved please execute
    "/etc/init.d/ipvsadm save".
